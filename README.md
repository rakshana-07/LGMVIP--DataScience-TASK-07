## Introduction

Handwriting recognition is a computer vision task that involves recognizing and transcribing handwritten text or characters. In this project, we leverage the power of CNNs to build a robust handwriting recognition system. CNNs are well-suited for image-based tasks like this due to their ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from input images.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or any other deep learning framework
- NumPy
- matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
https://github.com/rakshana-07/LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-07

```

2. Prepare your dataset as described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

3. Modify the hyperparameters and configurations in `config.py` according to your requirements.

4. Train the model using the [Training](#training) guidelines.

5. Evaluate the model's performance using the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section.

## Dataset

For this project, we use the [Handwritten Characters Dataset](link-to-dataset) containing handwritten characters. You can download and preprocess the dataset as needed for your experiments.

## Model Architecture

Our CNN model for handwriting recognition consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The architecture can be found in the `model.py` file.

## Training

To train the model, use the provided `train.py` script. Adjust the hyperparameters and settings in `config.py` before running the training script.

```
python train.py
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using the `evaluate.py` script. This will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

```
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

Document the results of your experiments here. Include visualizations, performance metrics, and any insights gained from the trained model.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Implement more complex network architectures, such as ResNet or DenseNet.
- Investigate transfer learning by using pre-trained CNNs.
